# Hi, I’m Paul 
I’m a fullstack dev based in Ireland, currently working for Rapid7.

I like making side projects, here are some things that I've built: 

- [🍄 paultreanor.com](https://paultreanor.com/) - My digital notebook, always a work in progress
- [🌎 MapGuesser.com](https://www.mapguesser.com/) - A map game I built for fun
- [🔖 PromptMarker](https://paultreanor.com/promptmarker) - An ChatGPT wrapper with some UI bells and whistles I wanted
- [📅 Notes Dater](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=notes-dater) - An [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to track when notes are created and edited
- [🦁 TimeTamer](https://paultreanor.com/time-tamer) - A productivity tool I built to track my time
- [👋 OpenHands](https://github.com/PaulTreanor/OpenHands) - A hand gesture recognition system I built in college


I've also done some talks that I'm proud of:

- [Building your own tools](https://paultreanor.com/build-tools)
- [CodeSpaces - Beyond local dev](https://paultreanor.com/codespaces)

Feel free to get in touch.
